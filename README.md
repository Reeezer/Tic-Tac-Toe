# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game, but this project takes it a step further by creating a visually appealing and interactive version of the game.

The objective of this project is to provide a fun and engaging experience of playing Tic Tac Toe. The game offers an attractive and user-friendly interface that enhances the overall gameplay.

Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to form a line of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The interactive nature of the game allows players to click on the desired grid spaces to make their moves.

The project focuses on ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience. It incorporates features such as highlighting the winning line, providing sound effects for moves and victory, and displaying a clear and appealing game board.
